# Havel Hakimi Algorithm
It is a widely used algorithm in graph theory, and has applications in various fields such as computer science, social network analysis, and biology.
The Havel-Hakimi algorithm is a simple algorithm used to test whether a given sequence of non-negative integers can be the degree sequence of a simple graph.Â 
In other words, it checks whether it is possible to construct a graph with the given degrees for each vertex, without any loops or multiple edges.
